## Why GIMBAP?

Gimbap is a Korean-style sea-weed roll with various ingredients inside. It is a simple and easy to make dish that is popular in Korea. The name GIMBAP is chosen as the acronym because it's one of my favourite dishes!.

Gimbap is a food where vegetables, fish and meat are rolled in a seaweed sheet with cooked rice. The seaweed sheet connects all the ingredients together and makes it easy to eat.

Like this GIMBAP aims to provide a simple solution to build web application in Go, connecting all components together in a simple and easy way.

## Disclaimer

GIMBAP is still in its **early stage of development**. It is not recommended to use this in production environment yet, and I am still working on to handle some of the key features that are missing or need improvement.

## Key Features

GIMBAP currently supports the following key features:

- Automatic Dependency Injection management
- API Endpoint management by code
- Flexible Server engine switching
- Containerized instance managing

## Goals

This framework provides the following features in the future

- Interceptor, Guard support
- Template engine support
- More to be added...
