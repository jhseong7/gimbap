# HTTPS/TLS Support

To use TLS with GIMBAP, you have to provide the certificate and the key files to the server engine.

The TLS options can be given in two ways:

1. As path to the certificate and key files.
2. As a `tls.Config` object.

## Using Certificate and Key file paths

The TLS option can be set as a runtime option upon starting the server.

```go
app.Run(gimbap.RuntimeOptions{
  Port: 8080,
  TLSOption: &gimbap.TLSOption{
    CertFile: "https/server.crt",
    KeyFile:  "https/server.key",
  },
})
```

The `CertFile` and `KeyFile` are the paths to the certificate and key files respectively. The server will use these file paths
regardless of the server engine used.

## Using `tls.Config` difectly

The `tls.Config` object can be used to set the TLS options.

```go
tlsConfig := loadTLSConfig()

app.Run(gimbap.RuntimeOptions{
  Port: 8080,
  TLSOption: &gimbap.TLSOption{
    Config: tlsConfig,
  },
})
```

## Check if the server is running with TLS

The app will show a message in the console if the server is running with TLS.

```sh
| SampleApp    | 9637   2024-11-22T12:21:23+09:00 LOG    [FiberHttpEngine]    - Starting the http engine with TLS on port 8080
```
