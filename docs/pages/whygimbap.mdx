Gimbap is a Korean-style sea-weed roll with various ingredients inside. It is a simple and easy-to-make dish that is popular in Korea. The name GIMBAP is chosen as the acronym because it's one of my favourite dishes!.

Gimbap is a food where vegetables, fish and meat are rolled in a seaweed sheet with cooked rice. The seaweed sheet connects all the ingredients together and makes it easy to eat.
