# Dependency Manager

## Introduction

GIMBAP uses DI(Dependency Injection) to manage the components of the application. The dependency injection is managed by a component named that implements the interface `IDependencyManager`.

The manager takes a set of providers and returns a map of instances with the dependencies resolved.

GIMBAP manages the graphs of dependencies given through the `Module` struct, automatically injects the dependency provides and initialized at least one instance of the given providers.

For example, if the app is given a module with a provider with a struct of `Service1` and `Service2`, where suppose `Service2` depends on `Service1`, GIMBAP will automatically create singleton instances of `Service1` and `Service2` and use the instance of `Service1` when initializing `Service2`.

This does not only apply to Service level providers. Any Go struct that is unique can be used as a provider where all components that require that as a parameter of the constructor will be automatically injected by the app.

The DI system in GIMBAP follows the following principles:

1. All components are singletons
   - A single type of provider will only have one instance in the app
2. All components are initialized at the start of the app
   - All components are initialized at the start of the app, and the app will not start if there are any errors in the initialization process

## Limitations

Since DI works by identifying the given struct's type and building the dependency graph upon it, there are some limitations to the DI system.

1. All dependency provider's type must be unique
   - 2 or more providers of the exact same type will cause a panic in the DI system
   - For the same reason, interfaces and array type structs are not supported as providers
2. Circular dependencies are not supported
   - Circular dependencies will cause a panic in the DI system
   - e.g. `A -> B -> C -> A` is not allowed

## Manager Selection

GIMBAP provides 2 types of dependency managers as of now:

1. GIMBAP Dependency Manager (default)
   - The default dependency manager that comes with GIMBAP
   - The manager is a simple implementation of the `IDependencyManager` interface
   - **Pros**: Simple, lightweight
   - **Cons**: Still in alpha, may have some bugs
2. Fx Dependency Manager
   - This is an implementation using `go.uber.org/fx` package
   - **Pros**: Stable, well-tested
   - **Cons**: Only supports providers with single return values

To select the manager, the app must provide the manager to the `App` struct. You can either designate nothing to use the default manager or provide the manager explicitly.

```go
import (
  "github.com/jhseong7/gimbap"
  "github.com/jhseong7/gimbap/dependency"
)
func main() {
  // Default manager
  app := gimbap.NewApp(
    gimbap.AppOption{
      AppModule: module,
    },
  )

  // Fx manager
  app = gimbap.NewApp(
    gimbap.AppOption{
      AppModule: module,
      DependencyManager: dependency.NewFxManager(),
    },
  )
}
```

## Custom Dependency Manager

If you want to implement your own dependency manager, you can do so by implementing the `IDependencyManager` interface.

The manager must implement the following methods:

```go
type (
	IDependencyManager interface {
		// ResolveDependencies the dependencies to the target
		//
		// The first parameter is the result map which contains the resolved dependencies.
		// The second parameter is the list of providers to resolve.
		ResolveDependencies(instanceMap map[reflect.Type]reflect.Value, providers []*provider.Provider)

		// Lifecycle methods
		OnStart()
		OnStop()
	}
)
```

`ResolveDependencies` takes in a list of providers and populates the given map with the resolved dependencies.

Once the custom manager is implemented, you can provide the manager to the `App` struct like below.

```go
import (
  "github.com/jhseong7/gimbap"
  m "github.com/jhseong7/some-custom-manager"
)

func main() {
  app := gimbap.NewApp(
    gimbap.AppOption{
      AppModule: module,
      DependencyManager: &m.NewCustomManager(),
    },
  )
}
```
