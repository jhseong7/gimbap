# Microservices

## Introduction

Microservices are special logics that are automatically started and stopped by the app's lifecycle. These are designed to be used for other types of servers other than the http server.

Examples of microservices are:

- gRPC servers
- Websocket servers
- TCP servers

The key difference between a microservice and a microservice is that a microservice are treated like dependency providers, thus are injected with dependencies if there are any.

Microservices must implement the interface `IMicroServices` which is defined as follows.

```go
type IMicroService interface {
  // Start the microservice
  Start()

  // Gracefully stop the microservice
  Stop()
}
```

The only thing GIMBAP manages for the microservices are:

- Lifecycle methods
- Dependency injections

So anything that needs to reside with the main server engine can be implemented as a MicroService.

The microservices must stop within 5 seconds when the Start(), Or Stop() is called. This is to prevent any blocking events on app closing.

The start and stop of the microservices are handled in order of the which it was added to the app via `app.AddMicroServices`
